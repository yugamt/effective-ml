# Testing in ML

## Why Should We Test?

- Easy to add new features
- To avoid a wasted training job.
- Better to find shortcomings on your own than from the clients.


## What to Test?

1. Pre-train Tests
    a. Testing the code and the data
    b. Similar to software testing and the same principles can be used.

2. Post-train Tests
    a. Testing the model (testing model’s skills)
    b. Well tested code and data are not sufficient to ensure the creation of a good model.
        i. Evaluation of validation set
        ii. Testing the model for some expected behaviour.
    c. These tests contain a set of inputs on which model’s performance is calculated.

## Pre-train Tests

- Testing the code and the data
- Similar to software testing and the same principles can be used.
- Types:
a. Unit tests:
    - To test small components of the code and the data.
    - Any new function/class added, should have unit test testing it’s functionality.
b. Regression tests:
    - To test bugs which have been encountered before and fixed.
    - Can be added as a new unit test.
c. Integration tests:
    - To test execution of multiple small components of the code.

## Unit Tests in ML
- Data
    - Check for Nan values at unexpected places.
    - Check for leakage in your splits (by intersection).
    - Check if features values are in the expected range. Similarly for categories.
- DataLoader
    - Check sample’s shapes (correct or not)
    - Check data loading (possible or not)
    - Check augmentations (applied or not, shapes)
    - Check everything separately for train and test samples.
    - Ex: Augmentations differ for train and test.
- Model
    - Check output shapes, forward pass.
    - Check cpu to gpu to cpu transfer.
    - Check sample independence.
    - Check gradient’s existence for all the expected parameters.
- Loss
    - Check output type, shape.
    - Check expected behaviour.
- Trainer
    - Ensure fitting (by overfitting a single batch).

## Post-train Tests

- Model evaluation on validation set

    - We usually do this.
    - Effective to compare between two models of 70% and 90% accuracy.
    - But comparing models of 90% and 91% accuracy gets tricky.
    - Better models could have unexpected failure modes such as bad performance on small objects, gender bias, sensitivity to low lighting conditions etc.

- Behavioural testing
    - Manual error analysis should be done to identify failure modes of the model.
    - Tests should be added to quantify these failure modes.
    - These tests would be problem, domain and dataset specific.
    - Broadly classified into three types
        - Invariance test
        - Directional expectation test
        - Minimum functionality test

## Invariance Test

#### Apply label preserving perturbations to inputs and expect model predictions to remain the same.

- Replace places names in sentiment analysis.
    - Examples:
        - @AmericanAir thank you we got on a different flight to [ Chicago → Dallas ].
        - @VirginAmerica I can’t lose my luggage, moving to [ Brazil → Turkey ] soon, ugh.
- Typos in sentiment analysis.
    - Examples:
        - The flight was great → The flght ws great.
        - Why are we getting so lazy → Why are we gettnig so lazy.
- Rotating images in object detection.

## Directional Expectation Test

#### Apply perturbations to the inputs and expect labels to change in a certain way.


- Keeping everything else the same, if house built up area is reduced, does the price increase?
- Adding a more negative sentence to the end should not make outputs more positive.
    - Examples:
        - @USAirways your service sucks. → @USAirways your service sucks. You are lame.
        - @JetBlue why won't YOU help them? → @JetBlue why won't YOU help them? I dread you.
- Replacing lower half of the image, increase the count?

## Minimum Functionality Test

#### Simple test cases designed to test a specific behaviour.

#### Analogous to unit test where we test the model on a small part of the data.

#### Failure modes discovered in error analysis can be tested with MFT.


-  Examples:
    - Testing on short, long sentences separately in sentiment analysis.
    - Testing on small, large objects in object detection.
    - Testing on each region’s samples separately.
    - Testing on simple sentences created with certain template in sentiment analysis:
        - Template: “I {negation} {positive verb} the {thing}”.
        - Sentences: I can’t say I recommend the book, I didn’t love the flight etc.

## Minimum Functionality Test

-  Examples:
    - In pest management’s trap based solution, one of the failure modes is accepting ‘white printed paper’ as a valid trap image.
